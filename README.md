I decided to make a free version because it's pretty simple and fun to make.
Sorry to the original creator if I fuck your sales up, but you probably never got any either way.


Step 1:
- Make sure you have Python installed (Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX2-V2BocqQ)
- Make sure "pip" is installed (Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPMr0lEMqpo)

Step 2:
- Run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3:
- Fill in the config.json file
- Webhook: To receive notifications, you must have a webhook setup for your server (Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS_981bBG-8)
- DeveloperID: Your discord Developer ID (Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T0L4c9hWTo)
- mybbuser: You require your OGUsers mybbuser cookie( Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36l3gKRKyfk)
- ColorHex: The color in which you desire your notifications to be
- Delay: Checks notification every X amount of seconds.
- LatestNotification: Do not touch.

Step 4:
